	The golden retriever is known for its obedience and intelligence, which makes it
	ideal as a service dog. Golden retrievers can be trained to be guide dogs, therapy dogs, 
	and even search dogs. One such example was the Bretagne, a Golden Retriever search dog that
	had helped search for survivors during 9/11. Bretagne also continued as a service dog during
	Hurricane Rita and Katrina. To learn more about Bretagne,

<h2> Personality </h2> 

<div class="section">
	<p> 
	Golden Retrievers generally have a fair temperment, which can make them suitable 
	for children and the rest of the family. However, given their size, golden retrievers
	are not always suitable for extremely small children (although this depends on the dog
	and family situation). Although the golden retrievers are not especially
	known for barking, they are generally not watchdogs, and typically lack strict guarding
	instincts. They also tend to be active dogs, requiring ample amounts of time for exercise.
