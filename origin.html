<h2> Origins </h2> 
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	The golden retriever breed was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century. 
	They were used to retrieve prey such as ducks and other game birds. Known for their 
	soft mouths, the Golden Retriever is able to carry objects without damaging them, 
	making them ideal for retrieving. Golden Retrievers are also prone to be swimmers, 
	as their outer coat repels water by lying flat against their body. Dudley Marjoribanks 
	has also been credited for developing the Golden Retriver Breed by breeding a Tweed
	water spaniel with a yellow retriever. The puppies were then breed with other dogs, 
	such as black retrievers, St. John's water dog, and the Irish setter. As the dog
	became more popular in England, the Golden Retriever would eventually be recognized 
	by The Kennel Club of England in 1911.

<h2> American retrievers </h2>
<div class="section">
	<p>
	There are primarily three types of golden retrievers: English, Canadian, and American, with varying golden, light 
	golden, and dark golden coats. American golden retrievers are typically smaller, 
	with less muscular bodies. They also tend to have darker coat colors and triangular-shaped eyes.
