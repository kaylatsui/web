	Golden Retrievers have thick coats, requiring specific brushes. They have both a guard
	coat and an undercoat, so the brush must penetrate both layers to prevent mats and tangling.
	Examples of different brushes include:
	</p>
	<ul> 
		<li> Slicker Brushes </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> Moves the top coat easily by using thin wire bristles. </li> 
			</ul>
		<li> Undercoat Rake </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> A "rake" that is deep enough to reach the undercoat of the dog. </li>
			</ul>
		<li> Wire Pin Brushes </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> Wire pin brushes are composed of long wire pins, which are used to remove 
			the tangles of the topcoat. However, these brushes are not ideal for removing 
			persistent mats or tangles, although they are useful for longer coats. </li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	Since golden retrievers tend to be active, they are prone to developing certain health
	complications, such as hip dysplasia. They sometimes have eye complications or even heart
	disease. For more information on the costs of preventing and treating these health complications,
	<a href= https://www.grrmf.org/learn/owning-golden-retriever/> please see this website. </a> 
	Please also note that, due to their retrieving nature, golden retrievers can be mouthy. 
	Although golden retrievers are known for being trainable, it is important to keep in mind their
	general characteristics.
