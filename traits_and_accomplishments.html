<h2> Traits and Accomplishments </h2>
	 
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	The golden retriever is known for its obedience and intelligence, which makes it
	ideal as a service dog. Golden retrievers can be trained to be guide dogs, therapy dogs, 
	and even search dogs. One such example was the Bretagne, a Golden Retriever search dog that
	had helped search for survivors during 9/11. Bretagne also continued as a service dog during
	Hurricane Rita and Katrina. To learn more about Bretagne,

<h2> Retrievers in Movies</h2>
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	Besides being service dogs, golden retrievers have become popular in pop culture. The family movie "Air Bud" features Buddy, a golden retriever
	that can play sports, who helps high schooler Josh with basketball. "Air Buddies" also consisted of five golden retriever puppies that go 
	on miscellaneous adventures.

		<li> "Air Buddies" includes five of Tucker's puppies: 
		<li> B-Dawg </li>
			<ul>
			<li> The "cool" dog known for having a feisty personality, although he is secretly 
			easily scared. He is the second-oldest puppy, and wears a silver chain necklace in the films. </li>
			</ul>
		<li> MudBud </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> MudBud likes to roll in the dirt. He is the youngest boy of the litter. </li>
			</ul> 
		<li> Rosebud </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> The only female puppy in the litter, Rosebud wears a pink bow on her head. Although she is personified in the films as being
			easily annoyed at her brothers' antics, she is also shown to be very protective of them. </li>
			</ul> 
	    <li> Buddha </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> Buddha is the calmest of the litter. The third oldest, Buddha balances out the rowdiness of the rest of his 
			siblings. </li> 
			</ul>
	    <li> Budderball </li> 
			<ul>
			<li> Budderball is the oldest of the litter. He enjoys eating and in the film, he is protrayed with black ink on his face like a football player, 
			since he is also dressed with a red football shirt. Budderball is a bit of a glutton, and his love for food can often distract him and 
			gets into trouble. </li>
			</ul>

<h2> Personality </h2> 
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	Golden Retrievers generally have a fair temperment, which can make them suitable 
	for children and the rest of the family. However, given their size, golden retrievers
	are not always suitable for extremely small children (although this depends on the dog
	and family situation). Golden retrievers are not especially
	known for barking, and are generally not watchdogs because they typically lack strict guarding
	instincts. They also tend to be active dogs, requiring ample amounts of time for exercise.
