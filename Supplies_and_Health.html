<h2> Supplies and Health </h2>
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	Golden Retrievers have thick coats, requiring specific brushes. They have both a guard
	coat and an undercoat, so the brush must penetrate both layers to prevent mats and tangling.
	Examples of different brushes include:
	</p>
	<ul class="outer_border"> 
		<li> Slicker Brushes </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> Moves the top coat easily by using thin wire bristles. </li> 
			</ul>
		<li> Undercoat Rake </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> A "rake" that is deep enough to reach the undercoat of the dog. </li>
			</ul>
		<li> Wire Pin Brushes </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> Wire pin brushes are composed of long wire pins, which are used to remove 
			the tangles of the topcoat. However, these brushes are not ideal for removing 
			persistent mats or tangles, although they are useful for longer coats. </li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	There are other various brush options for golden retrievers. To see more options,

	Since golden retrievers tend to be active, they are prone to developing certain health
	complications, such as hip dysplasia. They sometimes have eye complications or even heart
	disease. For more information on the costs of preventing and treating these health complications,
	<a href= https://www.grrmf.org/learn/owning-golden-retriever/> please see this website. </a> 
	Please also note that, due to their retrieving nature, golden retrievers can be mouthy. 
	Although golden retrievers are known for being trainable, it is important to keep in mind their
	general characteristics.

<h2> Diet</h2>	
<div class="section">
	<p> 
	Dogs should be fed mostly meat. However, according to the American Kennel Club, dogs can be fed certain vegetables in very small
	quantities. To read more about the foods dogs can and cannot eat, 
	<a href= https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/fruits-vegetables-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/> please refer to the American Kennel Club website. </a>
	It is also ideal to have a mixture of wet and dry food, as wet food provides hydration, while dry food helps improve dental health.

<h2> Dental Health </h2>
<div class="section">
	<p>
	Besides dry food,
	it is also recommended to clean the dog's teeth on a regular basis. For information on how to properly brush a dog's teeth,

    It is important to have toothpaste specific to dogs, as while brushing the dog is likely to swallow the toothpaste. 
	Human toothpaste contains Xylitol, which is a sweetener that can be toxic to dogs, resulting in 
	a drop in blood sugar levels and potential liver damage. Since Golden Retrievers are naturally mouthy, it is important
	to get the proper dental materials. To see the various dog toothpaste products,
