	<h2> Origins </h2> 
	<p> The golden retriever breed was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century. 
	They were used to retrieve prey such as ducks and other game birds. Known for their 
	soft mouths, the Golden Retriever is able to carry objects without damaging them, 
	making them ideal for retrieving. Golden Retrievers are also prone to be swimmers, 
	as their outer coat repels water by lying flat against their body. There are primarily
	three types of Golden Retrievers: English, Canadian, and American, with golden, light 
	golden, and dark golden coats. Canadian goldens tend to have a thinner coat than American
	goldens, while English goldens tend to have lighter fur colors.  Dudley Marjoribanks 
	has also been credied for developing the Golden Retriver Breed by breeding a Tweed
	water spaniel with a yellow retriever. The puppies were then breed with other dogs, 
	such as black retrievers, St. John's water dog, and the Irish setter. As the dog
	became more popular in England, the Golden Retriever would eventually be recognized 
	by The Kennel Club of England in 1911.

	<h2> Traits and Accomplishments </h2>
	<h2> Service Dogs </h2>
	<p> The golden retriever is known for its obedience and intelligence, which makes it
	ideal as a service dog. Golden retrievers can be trained to be guide dogs, therapy dogs, 
	and even search dogs. One such example was the Bretagne, a Golden Retriever search dog that
	had helped search for survivors during 9/11. Bretagne also continued as a service dog during
	Hurricane Rita and Katrina. To learn more about Bretagne,

	<h2> Personality </h2> 
	<p> Golden Retrievers generally have a fair temperment, which can make them suitable 
	for children and the rest of the family. However, given their size, golden retrievers
	are not always suitable for extremely small children (although this depends on the dog
	and family situation). Although the golden retrievers are not especially
	known for barking, they are generally not watchdogs, and typically lack strict guarding
	instincts. They also tend to be active dogs, requiring ample amounts of time for exercise.

	<h2> Supplies and Health </h2>
	<p> Golden Retrievers have thick coats, requiring specific brushes. They have both a guard
	coat and an undercoat, so the brush must penetrate both layers to prevent mats and tangling.
	Examples of different brushes include:
	<ul> 
		<li> Slicker Brushes </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> Moves the top coat easily by using thin wire bristles. </li>
			</ul>
		<li> Undercoat Rake </li> 
			<ul> 
			<li> A "rake" that is deep enough to reach the undercoat of the dog. </li>
			</ul>
		<li> Wire Pin Brushes </li>
			<ul> 
			<li> Wire pin brushes are composed of long wire pins, which are used to remove 
			the tangles of the topcoat. However, these brushes are not ideal for removing 
			persistent mats or tangles, although they are useful for longer coats. </li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	There are other various brush options for golden retrievers. To see more options,

	Since golden retrievers tend to be active, they are prone to developing certain health
	complications, such as hip dysplasia. They sometimes have eye complications or even heart
	disease. For more information on the costs of preventing and treating these health complications,
	<a href= https://www.grrmf.org/learn/owning-golden-retriever/> please see this website. </a> 
	Please also note that, due to their retrieving nature, golden retrievers can be mouthy. 
	Although golden retrievers are known for being trainable, it is important to keep in mind their
	general characteristics.
